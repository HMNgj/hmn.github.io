  <img class="small-white-border" src="download.jpg" /a picture of a man >
   <ul>
   <h2><li>Strangers in the night exchanging glances. </li>
     <li> Wandering in the night what were the chances.</li>
   <li> We'd be sharing love before the night wasthrough.</li> 
     <li> Something in your eyes was so exiciting. Something in
your smiles was so inviting.</li>
     <li> Something in my heart told me I must I must have you.</li>
     <li> Strangers in the night two lonely people we were strangers in
	 the night.</li>
	 <li> Up to the moment when we said the first hello.</li>
	<li>  Little did we know love was just a glance away.</li>
    <li> A warm embracing dance away.</li> 
	 <li> Ever since that night, we've been together.</li>
	 <li> Lovers at first sight.</li>
	 <li> In love forever.</li>
	 <li> It turns out so right for strangers in the night.</li></h2>
